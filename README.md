CSE_Training_2025

# Day 1 of Training

*Orientation Program*

- Firstly we attended orientation program organised by the faculty of CSE department in the auditorium
- There we learnt about our department, modules and faculty etc.

- **Topics Covered:**

**â€¢Difference between Linux and Windows OS**
# Linux vs Windows - Basic Differences

| Feature              | Linux                                    | Windows                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Source Code          | Open Source                               | Closed Source                             |
| Cost                 | Free (mostly)                             | Paid License (some versions free)         |
| Customization        | Highly customizable                       | Limited customization                     |
| Security             | More secure (due to permissions & open code) | More targeted by viruses                 |
| Command Line         | Powerful and widely used                  | Optional, mainly GUI based                |
| Use in Servers       | Widely used (e.g., Ubuntu Server, CentOS) | Less common                              |
| Updates              | User-controlled, frequent small updates   | Automatic, sometimes forced              |
| Gaming               | Fewer native games, improving via Steam   | Most games supported                      |


**â€¢Advantages of Linux over Windows:**
 -Free open source
 
 -More secure

 -Large and active community

**â€¢Linux is used widely by most of the product and service based companies**

**â€¢Learned about product based and service based companies**

**â€¢Learned and explored about various carrier options under CSE**

**â€¢Downloading process for linux:**
 â€¢Dowloaded 3 softwares:
  
  -Oracle Virtualbox
 
  -Microsoft Visual C++
 
  -Ubuntu 24.04.02

  **â€¢Booting and its types**
  - Booting is referred to as waking up the computer
  - # Cold Boot vs Warm Boot

| Boot Type  | Description                                                                 |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cold Boot  | When the computer is started from a completely powered-off state (eg, macOS). |          |
| Warm Boot  | When the computer is restarted without turning off the power (e.g.,windows).|



# Day 2 of Training

# Commands
- We learned and emplemented various commands in linux.
- Below are the commands we learnt today

| Command   | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|

- After learning, we practiced these commands on an online terminal


**ls**

- It lists all the directories and files

![Image Description](ls.png)

**mkdir**
   - It makes a new directory by using 'mkdir filename'
   - Here we made a new directory names newdirectory

**cd**
  - It changes the directory you are working on
  - Here we changed the directory to newdirectory

  ![mkdir and cd command output](mkdirandcd.png)

**cat**
 - It is used to create a file with content by using '>' operator
 - It is also used to display a file
 - Here we created a file named file1 and typed our content and then displayed file1 with cat.

![cat command output](cat.png)

**touch**
 - It is used to create a file without content
 - Here we created a file named file2 without any content in it.

![touch command output](touch.png)

**cp**
 - It is used to copy one file to another by using 'cp source_file destination_file'.
 - Here we copied the content of file1 to file2.

![cp command output](cp.png)

**whereis,** **whatis,** **whoami,** **pwd**

![ command output](whereis.png)

**mv**
 - It is used to rename a file
 - It is also used to move a file to a new directory
 - Here we renamed the file file2 to newfile

![mv command output](mv.png)



# DAY 3 of Training

# Dual Boot:
- Dual booting allows a computer to run two different operating systems, enabling users to choose which one to boot into upon startup.

# ISO file:
- In Linux, an ISO file is a single file containing a complete copy of the data from a CD, DVD, or other optical media, formatted as an ISO 9660 file system.

# Bare metal installation:
- It refers to setting up an operating system directly on a physical server's hardware, without any intervening virtualization layer like a hypervisor.

# VMware:
- VMware is a commercial product known for its enterprise-grade features, performance, and comprehensive support.

#  Virtual box:
-  VirtualBox is an open-source, free alternative, generally favored for personal use, testing, and development.
# Partitioning schemes:

- Dividing a hard disk into separate sections.

##  Difference Between MBR and GPT

| Feature                    | MBR (Master Boot Record)        | GPT (GUID Partition Table)              |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Maximum Partitions         | Up to 4 primary partitions       | Supports up to 128 partitions (by default) |
| Disk Size Support          | Up to 2 TB                       | Supports disks larger than 2 TB           |
| Partitioning Method        | Stores partition info in one place | Stores multiple copies for recovery     |
| Compatibility              | Older systems (BIOS)             | Modern systems (UEFI)                    |
| Security                   | No CRC protection                | Uses CRC for error checking              |
| Boot Mode                  | BIOS-based booting               | UEFI-based booting                       |
| Data Recovery              | Difficult                        | Easier (multiple headers)                |

# File and Directory permossions
-In Linux (like Ubuntu), permissions decide who can do what with a file or folder.

**chmod**
- chmod stands for change mode. It is used to change the permissions of files or directories in Linux.

**syntax**
-chmod [permission] [filename]  **for permission*
  - ./filename.sh **for displaying*

**chmod +x filename.sh**
- +x enables executable file

**chmod 444 filename.sh**
- 444 enables a read only file

**chmod 644 filename.sh**
- it enables permissions only to owner2.

# Redirection
- Redirection in Linux means sending the output or input of a command to somewhere else, like a file.
- Example: echo "Hello" > file.txt

## Redirection Operators in Linux

| Type         | Symbol | Example Command                  | Description                             |
|--------------|--------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Output       | `>`    | `echo "Hello" > file.txt`        | Writes "Hello" to `file.txt` (overwrites) |
| Append       | `>>`   | `echo "World" >> file.txt`       | Adds "World" to end of `file.txt`        |
| Input        | `<`    | `wc -l < file.txt`               | Reads `file.txt` as input to `wc -l`     |


# Pipe '|'
- In Linux, a pipe (|) is used to connect two commands â€” it takes the output of one command and passes it as input to another.

  **syntax**
  - command1 | command2
  - command1 â†’ generates output
  - command2 â†’ takes that output as input

  Example:

ls | sort

ðŸ“„ This lists all files (ls) and sorts them (sort).
